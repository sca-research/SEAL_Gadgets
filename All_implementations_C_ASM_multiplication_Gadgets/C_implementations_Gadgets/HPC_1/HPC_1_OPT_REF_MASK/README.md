**HPC_1**: Fig.2 (c)  in "Hardware Private Circuits: From Trivial Composition to Full Verification"




In this implementation,the **Opt_Ref_Mask** is in the paper: **Hardware Private Circuits: From Trivial Composition to Full Verification**, section "supplementary material": **Pseudo-code of optimized SNI refresh gadgets**

There are two implementations regarding section 4.3 (New refresh gadgets) in the paper. 

In **HPC1_OPT_Refresh_Masks_inside_hpc**, the Opt_Ref_Mask is considered to be a part of the body of HPC_1. 


In **HPC1_OPT_Refresh_Masks_outside_hpc**, the Opt_Ref_Mask is considered to be computed in advance.

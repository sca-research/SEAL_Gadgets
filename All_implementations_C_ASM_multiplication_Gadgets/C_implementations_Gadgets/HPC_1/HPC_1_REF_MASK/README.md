**HPC_1**: Fig.2 (c)  in "Hardware Private Circuits: From Trivial Composition to Full Verification"

In this implementation,the **RefreshMasks** is Algorithm 7 in the paper **Horizontal side-channel attacks and countermeasures on the ISW masking scheme**.

There are two implementations regarding section 4.3 (New refresh gadgets) in the paper. 


In **HPC1_RefreshMasks_inside_hpc**, the RefreshMasks is considered to be a part of the body of HPC_1. 


In **HPC1_RefreshMasks_outside_hpc**, the RefreshMasks is considered to be computed in advance.
